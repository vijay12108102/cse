       <h2> Translation:</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multilingual people are always in demand, so if you can speak two or more languages,
     consider starting a small business where you can monetize those skills.
     You can start looking for clients on websites like </span><a href="https://www.upwork.com/search/jobs/?q=translators">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upwork</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a

style="font-weight: 400;"> and slowly build your portfolio. Got only a few hours to spare each day? Translation is one of the
 best side business ideas to pursue. As you work successfully with more and more companies, you can hire more translators who 
 specialize in other languages to take things off your plate. 
 It’s also a good idea to market your business on </span><a href="/blog/social-media-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span 
    style="font-weight: 400;">social media websites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as it can help you reach a wider

<h2> Website Flipping:</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://exchangemarketplace.com/blog/website-flipping?prev_msid=37bf2f1d-F2C5-4EBD-E3B5-CA88E4268813"><span
     style="font-weight: 400;">Website flipping</span></a>
     <span style="font-weight: 400;"> is among the new business ideas that have got everyone from work-at-home to recent
         graduates excited. It involves buying an already running website, improving its design and content, and then 
         selling it for a profit. There are quite a few places where you can buy and sell websites to earn a profit. 
         Shopify’s marketplace </span>

         <span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, allows you to buy ecommerce websites that you can further improve
         via content marketing, SEO, and other tactics. Once your site begins to generate more revenue than when you acquired
          it, you can list it for sale on the marketplace.&nbsp;</span> </p>

<h2> home-based-catering:</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a knack for cooking and see it as a creative outlet, you can make a 
    decent income by opening a home-based catering business. The initial investment depends much on how big you want
     the setup to be. For example, if you start with smaller events that you can manage on your own, you should be able 
     to start your business for less. Most home-based caterers start by <a href="/blog/how-to-create-a-website">creating 
         a website</a>, experimenting with local food markets, or joining platforms that allow cooking experts to squeeze 
         some profits out of their culinary skills.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>online-tutoring:</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re an expert in art, maths, or another subject, you can start the business of 
    online tutoring. An essential prerequisite is having a bachelor’s degree in the subject you intend to teach, so make 
    sure to cover this area before you start. You can find online tutoring clients on sites like
 </span><a href="https://www.skooli.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skooli</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 
    and </span><a href="https://tutor.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
         For the best results, always teach subjects that relate to your area of expertise because you’ll be able to share your
          skills and constructive knowledge to enhance your students’ knowledge experience. You can deliver lectures and interact
           with your students over Skype, making online tutoring one of the easiest online businesses to start.

 <h2>website-testing:</h2>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that brands with a digital footprint hire real people to give feedback on their
     websites? The opinions allow them to address issues that their developers may have failed to identify. You can hire a bunch
     of people on a freelance basis and create your own website testing company. During projects, your employees will receive a 
     set of questions that they need to answer as they navigate a company’s website. Through video, they’ll communicate their 
     initial thoughts on the current user experience and how the site could be improved. You can find work through
      websites like </span><a href="https://www.usertesting.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;
        ">UserTesting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a
    href="https://ferpection.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ferpection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,
 and </span><a href="https://www.trymyui.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TryMyUI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>career-coaching:</h2>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With rising unemployment and a saturated job market, there’s no shortage of people 
needing help with finding jobs. If you have a talent for helping your friends and family find suitable employment, you can 
probably help others too. Consider starting a career coaching business where you help others figure out what is the best
 career for them, how to nail an interview, what traits define a good candidate, and more. You can look for clients in
  Facebook groups or on platforms like </span><a href="https://www.coach.me/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coach.me</span></a><span style="font-weight:
   400;">. The best thing about this business is that you can make money by conducting 4-5 hourly sessions a month. Plus,
    you can coach multiple clients in a single session. If you’re looking for good business ideas that won’t occupy too much 
    of your time, career coaching may be the right option for you.&nbsp;</span></p>
